\cvheading{Work Experience}
\place{The Foundry VisionMongers}{The Communications Building, Leicester Square, London, WC2H 7LT}
\fromto{June 2010}{Present}
I am a software engineer for the 3D painting projection application, Mari. I ported Mari from a Linux only application to Windows, updating the C++ source base as well as the SCons build system. I am responsible for the Ptex support in Mari, having taken it from early prototype to a full production implementation. Ptex required many problems to be addressed, including how to efficiently create and maintain dynamic UV maps of arbitrary geometry.
\begin{itemize}
\item Strong team member, with good communication skills. Jointly responsible for daily reports to collaborating offsite developers and code merges between sites.
\item I have stood in for the lead engineer when required.
\item Good relationships with users, including Pixar and Lucas Film.
\item Broad skills covering more than just programming. I will happily fix build scripts, help with documentation or QA, and manage builds for external release.
\end{itemize}

\place{Electronic Arts}{Onslow House, Onslow Street, Guildford, Surrey, GU1 4TL}
\fromto{March 2001}{May 2010}
From December 2009 to May 2010 I worked at Criterion Games, enhancing their rendering engine to become a multi-threaded/-CPU solution for Xbox360 and PlayStation 3, that was used in the "Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit" title.

Previously, I worked at EATech (formally Criterion Software), a central technology group supporting world wide game teams at Electronic Arts.
\begin{itemize}
\item Senior member of the technology team at EATech UK. Lead engineer for graphics technology for development and support, specializing on PlayStation 3.
\item Developed PlayStation 3 graphics technology, collaborating with EA teams to create the FightNight demo shown at the PlayStation 3 launch in 2005.
\item Involved with many other game titles, including Burnout Paradise, Skate (1--3 \& It), Mirror's Edge, Need For Speed Prostreet, Fight Night 3, Tiger Woods.
\item Developed RenderWare 3 and 4 middleware for Direct3D7--9 and OpenGL (Windows/OSX), and PlayStation 3.
\end{itemize}
\place{AAA Game}{5th Floor, Crown House, Linton Road, Barking, IG11 8GH}
\fromto{March 2000}{March 2001}
At AAA Game I was a games programmer, developing the Direct3D 6 engine for PC CD-ROM titles.

\place{University of Hertfordshire}{Address on previous page}
\fromto{October 1997}{February 2000}
After graduating, I taught A-level standard mathematics to engineering undergraduates, and researched numerical optimization techniques. In the 1998--9 academic year I was course leader on a second year module in the Mathematics degree teaching Fortran 90.
