        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>I am an industry experienced software engineer, living in West Sussex, England with my wife, son and mad spaniel. My career has spanned both the games and VFX industries. My primary interests are in computer graphics, both realtime GPU and photorealistic offline rendering. I also have interests in build systems, compiler best practices, CPU and GPU profiling, open source software, technical documentation and software architecture.</p>
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <h3>Current</h3>
        <p>In March 2017, I have returned to <a href="https://www.thefoundry.co.uk" target="_blank">The Foundry Visionmongers Ltd</a> as senior software engineer on the <a href="https://www.foundry.com/events/siggraph-2016/project-bunsen">Bunsen</a> project.<p>
        <h3>Previously</h3>
        <p>I have self-funded full-time development on my own software products from July 2015 to March 2017. These projects are still active, albeit just in my free-time now.<p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://buildamation.com" target="_blank">BuildAMation</a> (BAM), an open source build system based on C#, for desktop products.</li>
            <li><a href="http://director.markfinal.me.uk" target="_blank">Director</a>, a cross-platform desktop CG animation editor and visualisation, written in C++11, with realtime previews in <a href="https://www.opengl.org" target="_blank">OpenGL</a> and offline rendering support for Pixar's <a href="https://renderman.pixar.com" target="_blank">PRMan</a>, aimed at students/amateur/enthusiast artists to make CG short films.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_Games" target="_blank">Criterion Software</a>, <a href="https://www.ea.com" target="_blank">Electronic Arts (EA)</a>, and most recently, <a href="https://www.thefoundry.co.uk" target="_blank">The Foundry Visionmongers Ltd</a>.<p>
        <p>At Criterion, I worked on the graphics team for the middleware <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RenderWare" target="_blank">RenderWare</a>, versions 3 and 4, primarily on Windows, PlayStation 3 (PS3) and Xbox 360.</p>
        <p>At EA, I continued on the graphics team of in-house rendering technology, but also spent time on specific games teams to debug, develop and optimise their rendering code.</p>
        <p>At The Foundry, I had two roles: software developer on the <a href="https://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/mari" target="_blank">Mari</a> 3D painting product; and lead engineer for the DevOps team, supporting the development and QA teams for continuous builds, automated testing, source control, crash reports, and general "how to" advice.</p>
        <h2>Highlights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/user58998164/videos" target="_blank">Videos</a> that demonstrate features of Director.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C54bEFUXBnc" target="_blank">Mari's 2016 Sci-Tech award</a> - although I no longer develop Mari, I was given an acknowledgement (4 minutes, 5 seconds in).</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQ38aRr1Ug" target="_blank">Fight Night Round 3</a> trailer, at Sony's announcement of the PS3 at E3 2005. Myself and a team worked on the PS3 rendering code in RenderWare while the demo was created by EA's World Wide Visualization group in Vancouver.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Education</h3>
