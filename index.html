        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>I am an industry experienced software engineer, living in West Sussex, England with my wife, son and mad spaniel. My career has spanned both the games and VFX industries. My primary interests are in computer graphics, both realtime GPU and photorealistic offline rendering. I also have interests in build systems, compiler best practices, open source software, technical documentation and software architecture.</p>
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <h3>Current</h3>
        <p>I am self-funding development on my own software products:<p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://buildamation.com">BuildAMation</a> (BAM), an open source build system based on C#, for desktop products.</li>
            <li><a href="http://director.markfinal.me.uk">Director</a>, a cross-platform desktop CG animation editor and visualisation, written in C++11, with realtime previews in <a href="https://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> and offline rendering support for Pixar's <a href="https://renderman.pixar.com">PRMan</a>, aimed at students/amateur/enthusiast artists to make CG short films.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Previously</h3>
        <p>I have worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_Games">Criterion Software</a>, <a href="https://www.ea.com"</a>Electronic Arts (EA)</a>, and most recently, <a href="https://www.thefoundry.co.uk">The Foundry Visionmongers Ltd</a>.<p>
        <p>At Criterion, I worked on the graphics team for the middleware <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RenderWare">RenderWare</a>, versions 3 and 4, primarily on Windows, PlayStation 3 (PS3) and Xbox 360.</p>
        <p>At EA, I continued on the graphics team of in-house rendering technology, but also spent time on specific games teams to debug, develop and optimise their rendering code.</p>
        <p>At The Foundry, I had two roles: software developer on the <a href="https://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/mari">Mari</a> 3D painting product; and lead engineer for the DevOps team, supporting the development and QA teams for continuous builds, automated testing, source control, crash reports, and general "how to" advice.</p>
